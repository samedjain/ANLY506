###The Packages
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(plyr)
library(data.table)
library(cvequality)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(ggthemes)
library(gridExtra)
library(cowplot)
```

##Describing Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
bikeVendors <- read_csv(file.choose())
bikeVendors<-data.frame(bikeVendors)
head(bikeVendors,10)
```


The bike vendors dataset contains 35 different variables, and under each variable, there is a total of 97 observations. Some of the variables in the dataset include the bike model, the various categories that each bike highlighted falls under, as well as the price and other specifications. 

Next on we check on the variable specifications, on whether there are numeric characters and whether there are string characters. 

```{r}
str(bikeVendors)
```

There are 4 string characters in the dataset, namely; The model,category 1, category 2 and the Frame of each bike in the dataset, the remaining 31 variables are all numeric. It is also worth noting that the dataset has no missing variables.


In the dataset, we proceed and check for any missing values in the respective dataset variables. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
complete.cases(bikeVendors)
```

It is evident that there are no missing values in the dataset. Next on we check whether there are NA values in the dataset

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
is.na(bikeVendors)
```
Results show that there are no Na values in the dataset. From this preliminary description, we now proceed on the data exploration section. 

##Exploring Data

In checking on the specific bike category that has a higher sale compared to the other, we do a background check on the frequency of each grouping, to identify the respective number of sales that each bike receives. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
count(bikeVendors$category1)
count(bikeVendors$category2)
```

Under category 1, there are a total of bikes sold, 51 of which fall under the mountain category, and 46 of which fall under the road category. Therefore, the mountain bikes have a higher sale on category 1. On the other hand, moving to category two, the Elite road bikes have the high sales in the grouping, with other bikes falling below its sales rank. Next on we check on the most popular Frame

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
count(bikeVendors$frame)
```

From the results, it is clear that the carbon frame has a higher popularity compared to the aluminium one. 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
newMountain<-bikeVendors[bikeVendors$category1=='Mountain',]
sort(colSums(newMountain[,6:35]),decreasing = T)
```
In regards to the Mountain bike, Tampa 29ers has the most purchases, with a range of 0.8 in the frequency table. Next on we check on the most popular bikes around the Ann Arbor, Denver and San Francisco regions. In checking on the most popular bikes around this region, we first have to check on the highest frequency that falls under the three regions, which will aid in identifying the most popular bike. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##For Ann Arbor
a<-bikeVendors[bikeVendors$Ann.Arbor.Speed==0.033222591,]
a$model
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##FOr Denver
b<-bikeVendors[bikeVendors$Denver.Bike.Shop==max(bikeVendors$Denver.Bike.Shop),]
b$model
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#For San Fransisco
c<-bikeVendors[bikeVendors$San.Francisco.Cruisers==max(bikeVendors$San.Francisco.Cruisers),]
c$model
```


In Ann Arbor, the Supersix Evo Hi-Mod team and the Synapse Claris are the most popular bikes, while in Denver,the Catalyst 2 is the most popular bike. Finally, in San Fransisco, the most popular bike is the CAAD12 Red. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clusters<-kmeans(bikeVendors[,6:35],5)
str(clusters)
```

Checking On the cluster algorith, we can make a conclusion that indeed clusters exist in the dataset. Next on we move on to check on whether there are variations in the dataset. We will use the Cvequality package check on whether there are variations in the bike vendors dataset. First, we would like to check whether there is any existing variation in category one, compared to the price of a specific bike. Below is a representation of the spread of the category one compared to the price

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bikeVendors,aes(category1,price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.05) +
  theme_dark()+
  ggtitle("A Comparison of the Various bikes in category One versus the Price")
```

Looking at the plot, it is evident that the plot representation is quite similar, and would be difficult to prove on any existing variation, so we proceed further and use the asymptotic test to test on the variation between mountain and road bikes. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bike_price_by_category1_test <- with(bikeVendors, 
       asymptotic_test(price,category1))
bike_price_by_category1_test
```

From the test, it is evident that the coefficients of variations in the mountain and Road bikes are similar and therefore there is no difference in the price variation in the two. We repeat the same procedure for category 2 to ascertain whether the same holds. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bikeVendors,aes(category2,price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.05) +
  theme_dark()+
  ggtitle("A Comparison of the Various bikes in category two versus the Price")
```

There seems to be a variation in the prices of bikes on category two, where sport bikes are relatively lower than the other groupings. To ascertain this, we check on the asymptotic test results. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bike_price_by_category2_test <- with(bikeVendors, 
       asymptotic_test(price,category2))
bike_price_by_category2_test
```
Checking on the test results, it is evident that there exists a variation in the sports bike grouping. 

We further proceed to compare on the bikes sold on these respective regions, in regards to the different categories as well as the price grouping. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Next on we plot the bike sales for the two in regards to category 2 of the respective bikes

dddd = dddd + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


Based on Category 1 grouping of the bikes, we can deduce the following in regards to the East versus West Coast, the highest bike sale is made on Miami, and this is in regards to the Road Bike. On the other hand, the lowest sale is made on San Fransisco and Seattle, on regards to the Mountain Bike. The West Coast is generally composed of most sales being of the Road Bikes, Whilst the East coast has a mixed uniformity in regards to bike Purchase. 

Next on we Check on the two regions based on category two of bike Sales. In the grouping, It is evident that San Francisco tops the group in regards to the Triathalon bike sale, with most sales being observed in the city, whilst The least sales on the city are in terms of the cross country and sport bikes. Also, Seattle has a weak sale in regards to the Over mountain bikes. On the East coast, The most sales observed are on the Cyclocross, mostly sold in Miami, while the least sale is on Pittsburgh, in regards to the Elite road, Endurance road and the Triathalon bikes. 

Next on we check on the most zero bikes sales in the cities. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res_Zeros <- colSums(bikeVendors[,6:35]==0)
res_Zeros
sort(res_Zeros,decreasing = T)
```

Seattle has the most zeros in bike sales, while Providence has the least number of zeros in bike sales, meaning that it has the most diverse in bike sales.
